This utility library can be used freely, and we are happy about bug reports.
However, a word of warning is in order. Some of the functions have not been testen,
and are therefore broken.

If you want to use it, the shifter, bitdetection and fifo parts are doing fairly well in
JetStream, so those are expected to be working, however not all configurations have been tested.

Furthermore if you would like to use the VHDL utility library, please note that it is written in VHDL 2008.
